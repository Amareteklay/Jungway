# Jungway Portfolio Project 1
Jungway is a website that provides users with relevant information on Jungian Psychology, the psychological methods that Carl Gustav Jung applied. 
All users will get brief introduction, a sort of map, to the key ideas. Users who want to dig deeper will find links to many resources online, including Jung's own works as well as more accessible materials such as podcasts. 
## UX
The home page is divided into sections. Users can easily learn about what Jungway holds for them by jumping between sections. The other pages give details of the information provided in each section. The background color and the font color contrast well, enabling users to read content easily. The contact form sticks at the bottom in each page. Users can navigate between different pages, so wherever they are, users can find their way to what they want to visit next. 
External links open in new tabs. So users do not get interrupted from what they have been reading.

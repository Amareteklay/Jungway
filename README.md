# Jungway
We live in an era of information overload, short attention span, and a pandemic that has forced us to spend more time with ourselves. Each of these has the potential to reveal how tiny a space one occupies in the vast world and how fragile one’s ego is. 
The rationale for Jungway is to introduce users to the Jungian way of understanding ourselves and the world. Empowering the individual is an important part of building a resilient society, and one way of achieving that is by helping them embrace their shadow and go through the process of individuation. Jungway is a gateway towards that process. It provides users with relevant information on Jungian Psychology, the psychological methods that Carl Gustav Jung developed.
Jungway is a sort of map with signposts of Jung’s brief bio, his key ideas, and for users who want to dig deeper, of links to many resources online, including Jung's own works. Users can find lists of popular books as well as links to more accessible materials such as podcasts. 

## Goals
#### User’s goal: 
Get a structured introduction to the concepts in and materials of Jungian psychology.
#### Owner’s goal: 
Promote the ideas of Jung in such a way that helps each user to become a better person.

## UX
The home page is divided into sections. Users can easily learn about what Jungway holds for them by jumping between sections. The other pages give details of the information provided in each section. The background color and the font color contrast well, enabling users to read content easily. The contact form sticks at the bottom in each page. Users can navigate between different pages, so wherever they are, users can find their way to what they want to visit next. 
External links open in new tabs. So users do not get interrupted from what they have been reading.

### Features 

#### Existing features
##### Navigation bar:
The header section of Jungway has a logo and a menu. The logo is a text with nicely contrasting white and orange colors. The logo is linked to the home page and users can click the logo from any page and they will return to the home page. 
The menu on the header has four menu items. When a user clicks each menu item from the home page, it shows the section of the page. If the user is in other pages than the home page and clicks each menu item, the home menu opens the home page, about opens the about page, resources opens the resources page and contact takes the user to the contact section of the page currently open. That way, the user can easily navigate through Jungway. 
##### Home page
divided into four sections
##### Hero Image:

##### About Section
•	About section: briefly introduces Jung’s bio and key concepts in Jungian psychology. Two links are provided to help interested users to read the full bio as well as a description of the key concepts. Through the links, users can see two pages.
•	About page: is a biographical description of Jung and his life. First time users benefit from reading this. Jung’s life is interesting in that his thoughts are very much linked to his own psychological experiences. So this page inspires readers to find out more about Jung’s works. 
•	Ideas page: gives an overview of the Jungian tradition by defining key concepts and terms. For beginners, Jung’s ideas may at times be intimidating, so a gentle introduction to the core concepts and how they relate to each other paves the way for a deeper dive into Jungian analysis.

##### Resources section
•	Resources section: this is another section on the home page with a video from the horse’s mouth (Jung’s interview) and links to different sections of a dedicated page for providing resources. When a user clicks on the ‘Learn more’ link, the resources page opens.
•	Resources page: is a collection of different resources about Jungian psychology. The resources are categorized into books, videos, podcasts and formal training programs. The links on the resources section of the home page open the respective category of the resources page. For semantic purposes, the entire resources page has two sections, the content which is divided into articles and the contact sections. 
Videos: videos are taken from YouTube and embedded in the appropriate section or page. They can be played on the page or opened in YouTube on a new tab. 
Podcasts: links to podcasts point to the websites of the podcasts listed. The alternative would be to list episodes but that would create choice overload for the user. By linking the post popular podcasts on Jungian analysis, the user gets to choose the podcast they like first and then the episode(s).

##### Contact section
•	Contact section:  this section appears both on the home page and other pages. As users may want to send comments or questions that they have at any part of the website, the contact form is available to them all the time.
##### Footer
•	The footer: is also visible in all pages. It displays social icons linked to different social media platforms which open in new tabs, and a copyright paragraph with link to the home page.

        <h2>Key Ideas in Jungian Psychology </h2>
        <p> Jung founded analytical psychology which is also called depth psychology or Jungian analysis or Jugian
            psychology. The key
            features of this approach are that the human psyche has both the conscious and unconscious elements and that
            by integrating the two a balanced psychological condition can be achieved. </p>
        <p> The fact that the unconscious is unconscious makes it difficult if not impossible to deal with it. Jungian
            analysis, however, uses symbols
            and feeling functions to tap into the message that the unconscious tried to send. The goal is what Jung
            called individuation, the full realization of one's potential.</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/44379-until-you-make-the-unconscious-conscious-it-will-direct-your">
            <p> Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.</p>
            <p>Carl Jung</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> One should know some key terminology to understand Jungian approach (the Jungway) and apply it to one's
            life. Many Jungian analysts propose that one live the questions instead of the answers in so far as one is
            committed to exploring what this thing called life is all about. </p>
        <p> The following are key concepts and ideas in Jungian analysis. Have them for the journey ahead.</p>
        <p><b>Individuation:</b> the process by which a person integrates unconscious contents into consciousness,
            thereby becoming a psychologically whole individual.</p>
        <p><b>Persona:</b> a complicated system of relations between the individual consciousness and society. It is
            kind of a mask, designed on the one hand to make definite impressions upon others, and, on the other, to
            conceal the true nature of the individual</p>
        <p><b>Shadow:</b> cast by the more individualized ego, it's the repressed, inferior layer of the personal
            unconscious. Its contents are emotional and imaginal. All we deny, fear, or hate in ourselves collects in
            the shadow, which appears in dreams as a frightening figure of the dreamer's gender (because it's part of
            his or her ego). “Realization of the shadow” means growing fully, emotionally conscious of the shadow's
            contents, a moral problem evaded by people whose respectable conscious selves deny the shadow and project it
            into personal, family, or cultural scapegoats. The shadow is often contaminated by inferior
            function/attitude, anima, etc. identification with the shadow produces a kind of amoral, inflated craziness.
        </p>
        <p><b>The Self:</b> the central, organizing, governing archetype of the collective unconscious and template for
            the ego. It contains all the other archetypes. The nucleus of the psyche (central fire). It's the archetype
            of growth. Its physiological aspect Jung thought could be located in the brainstem. The Self refers to the
            entire psyche, both the conscious and the unconscious.</p>
        <p><b>Dreams:</b> Spontaneous and natural manifestation of the psyche. symbolic expressions of the unconscious
            (and of the total psyche). A phylogenetically older form of thought. The dream is a fact of objective nature
            and therefore not a disguise.</p>
        <p><b>Archetypes:</b> universal, primal symbols and images that derive from the collective unconscious. They are
            the psychic counterpart of instinct, a kind of innate unspecific knowledge, derived from the sum total of
            human history, which prefigures and directs conscious behavior. They are underlying base forms from which
            emerge images and motifs such as the mother, the child, the trickster, and the flood among others.</p>
        <p><b>Anima and animus:</b> are respectively the archetype of female in man and the archetype of male in woman.
        </p>
        <p><b>Collective unconscious:</b> the part of the unconscious mind which is derived from ancestral memory and
            experience and is common to all humankind, as distinct from the individual's unconscious. It involves
            holding an image in awareness while fantasizing and associating to it to bring it to life and discover its
            nuances and unconscious roots.</p>
        <p><b>Active imagination:</b> the method of assimilation of unconscious contents through their experimentation
            as fantasies in the wakeful state.</p>
        <p><b>Synchronicity:</b> a meaningful, but noncausal, connection between an inner and outer event separated by
            time and space, but a whole at some level. For example, waking up (inner event) near the time a relative
            dies (outer event). In short, it is a non-causal connection between two or more various phenomena (psychic
            and/or physical).</p>

        <h2>Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961)</h2>
        <p>Carl Gustav Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded and can be thought of as the father
            of analytical psychology. He was born on 26 July 1875 and died at the age of 86 on 6 June 1961. In 1903 Jung married Emma Rauschenbach. She was his loyal companion and scientific coworker until her death in 1955. The couple had five children, and lived in Küsnacht on the Lake of Zurich.</p>
         <p> The influence of Jung's work is not limited to psychology. It permeates the fields of psychiatry,
            anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, and even religious studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jung and Sigmund Freud met in 1907 when the former worked as a research scientist at the famous Burghölzli
            hospital. Freud was the founder of psychoanalysis.
            The two men remained friends and had correspondence and collaboration for five years. With the publication
            of Jung's "Psychology of the Unconscious,"" came their inevitable break up.
        </p>
        <p>
            To Jung, the human psyche exists in three parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The conscious mind (the ego, a term that Freud popularized)</li>
            <li>The personal unconscious, and</li>
            <li>The collective unconscious (this marks one of the clear differences between Jung and Freud)</li>
        </ul>
        <p> In addition to their different conceptions of the unconscious, Jung and Freud did not agree on the
            interpretation of dreams. Sex and sexuality, and religion and mysticism were also other sources of
            divergence and disagreements between their visions of human psychology. Unlike Freud, Jung believed for
            example that the libido was not just sexual energy but rather a form of psychic energy, which means it has a
            potential to be embodied in other ways than just sex. </p>
        <p> Jung was known for his immense knowledge in mythology, religion and philosophy and deep understanding of
            human symbols as in the traditions such as Alchemy, Kabala, Buddhism and Hinduism. He believed that “humans
            experienced the unconscious through numerous symbols encountered in various aspects of life such as dreams,
            art, and religion.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Jung was also an artist, craftsman, builder and a prolific writer. Many of his works were not published until after his death and some are still awaiting publication.
